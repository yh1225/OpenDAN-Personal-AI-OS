OpenDAN is an open source Personal AI OS, which ensures that everyone has the ability to use AI safely, freely, and equally.

## **Project Introduction**

The goal of OpenDAN (Open and Do Anything Now with AI) is to create a Personal AI OS. With OpenDAN, users can effectively manage their private data in the personal domain and create secure, free, and personalized private AI applications using this data.

This project is still in its very early stages, and there may be significant changes in the future.
